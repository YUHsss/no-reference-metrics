# Image Quality Assessment Metrics (PSI AND JNB)

This repository provides MATLAB implementations of various image quality assessment metrics, including the Perceptual Similarity Index (PSI) and the Just Noticeable Blur (JNB) metric.

## Perceptual Similarity Index (PSI)

The MATLAB implementation of the Perceptual Similarity Index (PSI) in this repository is based on the work available at [https://github.com/feichtenhofer/PSI](https://github.com/feichtenhofer/PSI).

## Just Noticeable Blur (JNB)

The Just Noticeable Blur (JNB) metric implemented in this repository is a reproduction based on the following paper:

> R. Ferzli and L. J. Karam, “A no-reference objective image sharpness metric based on the notion of just noticeable blur (JNB),” IEEE Trans. Image Process., vol. 18, no. 4, pp. 717–728, Apr. 2009.

This implementation aims to faithfully replicate the method described in the paper to evaluate image sharpness without requiring a reference image.

## Usage

To use the implementations provided in this repository, you can clone the repository and run the MATLAB scripts in your MATLAB environment.
